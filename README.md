# Leetcode Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems. All solutions are written in Python.

# Structure
- Each problem has its own folder, titled with its name and number. 
- Within each folder: 
    - `explanation.md`: text file to document my problem-solving process and my reflection. 
    - `final.py`: my final code
    - `solution{x}.py`: each iteration of my code.
    - Within each Python file:
        - brief documentation of my approach
        - time/space complexity
        - any issues I had
        - tests I ran to test the functionality of the code. 

- Templates folder:
    - `solution-template.py`: template for Python files
    - `explanation-template.md`: template for documentation
    - copied into new Python/explanation files for each problem

## Usage
To run a solution locally:

```bash
python <problem-folder>/final.py
